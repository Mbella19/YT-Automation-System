# 📖 Narration Style Guide - Movie Recap Storytelling

## The Problem We Fixed

**Original style was too literal:**
```
❌ "A helicopter flies over water. Three boats are moving. 
    A person is being lifted. They are transporting someone."
```

This sounds like **describing what you see**, not telling a story.

## The Solution: Storytelling Narration

**New style is engaging and narrative-driven:**
```
✅ "In the middle of the ocean a helicopter and three motorboats 
    with a rescue team approach a crash site. It turns out a 
    NASA capsule has had an accident and the astronaut Sam has 
    to be retrieved. They put her on a boat and quickly take 
    her to the hospital."
```

This tells the **STORY** - what's happening in the plot, character names, motivations!

## 🎬 Narration Philosophy

### Movie Recap Channel Style

Your narration should sound like popular movie recap channels on YouTube:
- **Mystery Recapped**
- **Daniel CC Movie**
- **Story Recapped**

**Characteristics:**
- ✅ Story-focused, not just visual description
- ✅ Character names and motivations
- ✅ Plot progression and beats
- ✅ Engaging, keeps viewer interested
- ✅ Present tense narrative flow
- ✅ Reveals what's happening in the story

**NOT like:**
- ❌ Documentary narration
- ❌ Literal visual description
- ❌ Technical scene description

## ✅ Examples of CORRECT Narration

### Example 1: Rescue Scene
```
✅ EXCELLENT:
"In the middle of the ocean a helicopter and three motorboats with 
a rescue team approach a crash site. It turns out a NASA capsule 
has had an accident and the astronaut Sam has to be retrieved. 
They put her on a boat and quickly take her to the hospital."

Why it works:
- Tells what's happening in the plot
- Names the character (Sam)
- Explains the situation (NASA accident)
- Shows progression (approach → retrieve → hospital)
- Engaging and informative
```

### Example 2: Mystery/Suspense Scene
```
✅ EXCELLENT:
"Sam wakes up feeling extremely dizzy. As she looks around the room 
she's shocked to find a pen floating above a tray. She's about to 
reach for it but she gets distracted by some people entering the 
room. When she looks again the pen is on the tray."

Why it works:
- Character's experience (Sam wakes up dizzy)
- Plot mystery (floating pen)
- Character reaction (shocked)
- Story progression (distraction → pen falls)
- Creates intrigue
```

### Example 3: Confrontation Scene
```
✅ EXCELLENT:
"The detective realizes the suspect has been lying all along. He 
confronts him with the evidence and the man finally breaks down 
confessing everything while tears stream down his face."

Why it works:
- Story revelation (lying)
- Character action (confronts)
- Plot resolution (confession)
- Emotional detail (tears)
- Narrative payoff
```

### Example 4: Action Scene
```
✅ EXCELLENT:
"As the building explodes behind him, Marcus dives through the 
window barely escaping the fireball. He hits the ground hard and 
rolls to safety just as debris rains down around him."

Why it works:
- Action and stakes (explosion, escape)
- Character name (Marcus)
- Vivid action (dives, rolls)
- Tension and drama
- Story momentum
```

## ❌ Examples of WRONG Narration

### Example 1: Too Literal
```
❌ BAD:
"A helicopter is in the air. There are boats on the water. People 
are in the boats. Someone is being moved from one location to 
another."

Why it fails:
- Just describes visuals
- No character names
- No plot context
- Boring
- No story engagement
```

### Example 2: Too Technical
```
❌ BAD:
"The scene opens with an aerial shot of a rescue operation. 
Multiple vessels converge on a central point. An extraction 
procedure is initiated."

Why it fails:
- Sounds like a technical report
- No emotional engagement
- No character focus
- Not storytelling
```

### Example 3: References Outside Timestamp
```
❌ BAD:
"After escaping from the prison in the previous scene, John now 
finds himself running through the forest. This will lead to his 
eventual capture in the next sequence."

Why it fails:
- References "previous scene" (outside timestamp)
- Foreshadows "next sequence" (outside timestamp)
- Breaks immersion
- Causes audio-video desync
```

## 🎯 The Narration Formula

### For Each Scene:

```
1. WHO is involved? (Character names if known)
   "Sam...", "The detective...", "Marcus..."

2. WHAT is happening? (Plot action, not just visuals)
   "wakes up dizzy", "realizes the truth", "escapes"

3. WHY does it matter? (Story context within the scene)
   "It turns out...", "She's shocked to find...", "barely escaping..."

4. HOW does it unfold? (Progression within the timestamp)
   "approach → retrieve → take to hospital"
   "wakes → sees floating pen → gets distracted → pen falls"

5. Make it ENGAGING
   "extremely dizzy", "shocked", "barely escaping", "breaks down"
```

---

## 🔑 Key Principles

### 1. Story Over Visuals
**Don't say:** "A person walks into a room"
**Do say:** "The detective enters the suspect's apartment searching for clues"

### 2. Character Names
**Don't say:** "A woman looks surprised"
**Do say:** "Sam looks surprised"

### 3. Plot Context (Within Timestamp!)
**Don't say:** "Someone is running"
**Do say:** "Marcus runs from the explosion"

### 4. Emotional Detail
**Don't say:** "A man talks"
**Do say:** "He breaks down confessing everything while tears stream down his face"

### 5. Cause and Effect (Within Scene)
**Don't say:** "A car crashes. A man is injured."
**Do say:** "The car slams into the barrier and John is thrown against the airbag"

## 📝 Updated Prompts

### Two-Pass Mode (Recommended)

**Pass 1:** Extract timestamps (unchanged)

**Pass 2:** Generate storytelling narration
```
"Watch ONLY {start_time} to {end_time} and write a 
CAPTIVATING STORY narration.

Write like a MOVIE RECAP CHANNEL:
- Focus on PLOT, CHARACTER ACTIONS, STORY BEATS
- Tell what's happening in the STORY
- Include character names
- Make it engaging

Examples: [Your examples included]
```

### Single-Pass Mode

Same storytelling focus:
```
"Write CAPTIVATING STORY NARRATION like a movie recap channel.
Focus on PLOT progression, character actions, story beats.
Make it ENGAGING and narrative-driven."
```

---

## 🎨 Tone Guidelines

### ✅ Use Engaging Language

**Boring:** "goes", "moves", "looks"
**Engaging:** "rushes", "storms", "peers", "realizes"

**Boring:** "A person is sad"
**Engaging:** "Tears stream down her face", "breaks down crying"

**Boring:** "Something happens"
**Engaging:** "suddenly", "shockingly", "barely", "desperately"

### ✅ Present Tense Narrative
```
✅ "Sam wakes up feeling dizzy"
❌ "Sam woke up feeling dizzy"
❌ "Sam will wake up feeling dizzy"
```

### ✅ Natural Flow
```
✅ "In the middle of the ocean a helicopter and three motorboats 
    approach a crash site"
    
❌ "A helicopter approaches. Three motorboats approach. 
    It is a crash site."
```

## 📊 Before vs. After Comparison

### Before (Literal Style)
```
Scene 1: "A helicopter is visible in the sky. There are boats 
         in the water. People are in the boats. An object is 
         being retrieved."

Scene 2: "A woman is in a bed. Her eyes open. She looks at an 
         object. The object is in the air. The object falls down."
```

### After (Storytelling Style)
```
Scene 1: "In the middle of the ocean a helicopter and three 
         motorboats with a rescue team approach a crash site. 
         It turns out a NASA capsule has had an accident and 
         the astronaut Sam has to be retrieved."

Scene 2: "Sam wakes up feeling extremely dizzy. As she looks 
         around the room she's shocked to find a pen floating 
         above a tray. She's about to reach for it but she 
         gets distracted by some people entering the room."
```

**Difference:**
- ✅ Character names (Sam)
- ✅ Story context (NASA accident, rescue mission)
- ✅ Emotional states (dizzy, shocked)
- ✅ Plot progression (approach → retrieve → hospital)
- ✅ Engaging language
- ✅ Natural narrative flow

## 🎓 Tips for Best Results

### 1. Video Selection
**Best videos for this system:**
- Clear storytelling
- Defined characters
- Linear or semi-linear plots
- Visible character actions

**Challenging videos:**
- Abstract/artistic films
- Heavy dialogue with minimal action
- Very fast-paced action (hard to capture in 8-10s)

### 2. Scene Length
- 8-10 seconds is optimal for story beats
- Too short (< 5s): Hard to establish context
- Too long (> 15s): Audio gets lengthy

### 3. Review Process
1. Check `scenes.json` after analysis
2. Read narrations - do they tell a story?
3. Are character names included?
4. Is it engaging to listen to?
